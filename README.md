# CodePath-Project-0-SimpleToDo

Android Bootcamp Codepath Project SimpleToDo app

This android demo application puts together a simple ToDoList app. The app currently consits of two activitiy screens.
The first activity called the "SimpleToDo" activity lets the user enter text items which can later be edited incase the user wants to make corrections.
A Sqlite database has been configured for the data items to be stored instead of .txt file. (Previously, the .txt file had to be written and replaced each and every time a new data entry was recorded). 

The database can be edited to make changes to previously stored items. 
The second activity is the "EditScreen" activity that lets the user do the actual editing to a previously-saved item.

The Following Gif show's the working of the first screen of the app.
