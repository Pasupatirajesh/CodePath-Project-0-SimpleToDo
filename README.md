# CodePath-Project-0-SimpleToDo

Android Bootcamp Codepath Project SimpleToDo app

This android demo application puts together a simple ToDoList app. The app currently consits of two activitiy screens.
The first activity called the "SimpleToDo" activity lets the user enter text items which can later be edited incase the user wants to make corrections.
Currently the text items are stored and retrived from a .txt file that is stored in the application's data folder.
The second activity is the "EditScreen" activity that lets the user do the actual editing to a previously-saved item.
